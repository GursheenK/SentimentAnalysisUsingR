5.50E+17,Delta,Luis Stevens,@Delta Adria airways has the best pilots of all. Every flight is easy and you don? feel it. The touch down is always easy and comfortable such as you people has to wake you up..,,,Flight Staff,,
4.90E+17,Delta,James Smith,"@Delta I had a flight from Sofia to Copenhagen via Ljubljana - got stuck in Ljubljana because the flight had engine trouble. No information provided about alternatives or length of the delay - just continuous stalling: ""more information in an hour"" etc. Food after a few hours was a very dry cheese sandwich and a miniature bottle of water. Started to worry we would never leave. Finally, after a 6-hour delay, they used another plane to get us to Copenhagen. They dutifully handed out the EU compensation forms but completely ignored the claims made.

I'm now using a company to claim compensation and it is going to court - I'm sure I'll win but very doubtful I'll ever see my 250 Euros if the articles online are any indication. They must be in serious financial trouble! Would never fly again.",,,Cancelled flight,,
4.80E+17,US Airways,Adam Robinson,"@US AirwaysDear people be aware of some companies like this, they cancelled my flight 3 days before departure and damaged me in many ways because of this. Please be careful and do not buy. I contacted support, no help whatsoever from them. Not even the slightest approach from them. Be warned!.",,,Delay,,
4.60E+17,US Airways,Laura Merritt,@US Airways Was tiring.,,,Luggage Handling,,
6.60E+17,US Airways,William Clark,"@US Airways Decided to take this airline from Zurich to Slovenia.

Our 2pm flight was cancelled one week prior to our scheduled flight. We called their customer service at their local time (12 midnight in west coast USA). It took 45 minutes to get in touch of them but they have automated voice response noted your wait time is less than 2 minutes.

We were able to change our flight without cost added but we had to wait to we got to Zurich to get our seats together.

The flight itself wasn? bad. The people at the checkin area gave us the wrong baggage tags and had to get new ones at the gate.

I would try to avoid flying this airline.",,,All Services,,
